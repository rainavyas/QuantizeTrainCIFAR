# Objective

Images are typically stored in 3 channels (RGB), with each channel having 256 unique values (0-255). Here, CIFAR-10  images are quantized to a desired quantization value (<256) and these images are then used to train state of the art deep learning classifiers.

(CIFAR-100 functionality to be added soon)

# Requirements
