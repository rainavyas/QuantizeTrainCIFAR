# Objective

Images are typically stored in 3 channels (RGB), with each channel having 256 unique values (0-255). Here, CIFAR-100  images are quantized to a desired quantization value (<256) and these images are then used to train state of the art deep learning classifiers.

# Requirements

Minimum python3.7

## Install with PyPI

`pip install datasets`

`pip install torch, torchvision`

`pip install cnn_finetune`

`pip install numpy`
